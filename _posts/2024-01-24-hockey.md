# Motivation
In the fall semester of 2023, Tania Mendes Dias, Tiffany Maynard, Xin Yi Fang,
and I were tasked with predicting goal probabilities in NHL games. We built a a
pipeline for processing live data directly from the NHL api and generating a
summary of the shots and their expected outcome. The following post roughly
describes how we collected data, processed the data and built the model.
