Hi, I am Simon Théorêt

I am currently a Master student at Université de Montréal, set to complete my program in
april 2024. I am passionate about applying ML tools and new technologies to solve
technical challenges. Although most of my work is done with Python, I try to incorporte
as much Rust and Go in my projects, when these tools are helpful.

In my free time I enjoy good coffee and hiking (and sometimes both at the same time).
