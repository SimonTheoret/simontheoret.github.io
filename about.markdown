Hi, I am Simon Théorêt

I am currently a Master student at Université de Montréal, set to complete my
machine learning degree in april 2024. I am passionate about applying ML tools and new
technologies to solve technical challenges. Although most of my work is done
with Python, I try to incorporte Rust and Go in my projects, when these tools
are useful.

In my free time I enjoy good coffee and hiking (and sometimes both at the same time).
